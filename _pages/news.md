## January 2023

* We welcome 15 new and continuing undergraduate researchers to the Ralstonia Genomics CURE (Cohort-based Undergraduate Research Experience). Guided by Tiffany and PhD student Matt Cope-Arguello, the team is sequencing, assembling, and analyzing genomes of 24 Ralstonia isolates from Bangladesh. We are grateful to collaborators [Sally Miller](https://plantpath.osu.edu/our-people/sally-miller) and [Nagendra Subedi](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=S9iHqAUAAAAJ&hl=en) for allowing us to contribute to this excellent pathogen survey and analysis. 

* Tiffany and collaborator Caitilyn Allen finalized and submitted a manuscript that was nearly 20 years in the making (preliminary experiments by [Enid González-Orta](https://www.csus.edu/faculty/g/etgonzal/) and major work by Beth Dalsing and Alicia Truchon during their PhD theses). The paper included #overlyhonestmethods like "the genome analysis was performed on all of the Ralstonia genomes available in 2012". [Plant pathogenic Ralstonia phylotypes evolved divergent respiratory strategies and behaviors to thrive in xylem](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.11.09.515861v2.abstract) is currently available on BioRxiv and accepted to mBio. 

* Junior Specialist Jason Avalos is having a ball interviewing for a PhD in plant bacteriology related departments. We can't wait to see where he lands!

## Fall 2022

* Undergraduate Ariana Enriquez was awarded a Provost's Undergraduate Research Fellowship for her project mentored by Dr. Nathalie Aoun. 

* PhD students Matt Cope-Arguello and Stratton Georgoulis were both awarded Jastro Research Fellowships!

* We say goodbye to Dr. Becca Schomer, and we wish her luck in starting as an Assistant Professor at the University of Arizona. (She will be hiring!)

## Summer 2022

* PhD student Matt Cope-Arguello is becoming a microbial diversity wizard at the 6 week [Microbial Diversity course at MBL](https://www.mbl.edu/education/advanced-research-training-courses/course-offerings/microbial-diversity). 

* The lab welcomes Ariana Enriquez to the lab! Dr. Nathalie Aoun is mentoring Ariana on a project to understand host range in Ralstonia. This summer Yali Bai is working with Tiffany to apply her R prowess to visualize the Global Ralstonia Database, and Cloe Tom is learning how to clone with junior specialist Jason Avalos. 

* PhD student Stratton Georgoulis and Jason Avalos presented their research at the Phyllosphere meeting, and the [COSMOS students](https://cosmos.ucdavis.edu/) voted Jason's poster as one of two "top posters". Way to go, Jason!

* Tiffany had to write a "Covid Impact Statement" for her third year faculty merit review. Here is a twitter thread that [visualizes one of the few quantifiable impacts](https://twitter.com/TLowePower/status/1547736897526456322). 

* **August 2022**.  Jonathan Beutler's masters thesis paper is accepted in Phytofrontiers. [Whole genome sequencing suggests that “non-pathogenicity on banana (NPB)” is the ancestral state of the Ralstonia solanacearum IIB-4 lineage](https://apsjournals.apsnet.org/doi/10.1094/PHYTOFR-06-22-0068-SC).  Congrats Jonathan!  Read the [Twitter Summary here](https://twitter.com/TLowePower/status/1516839365594419201)


## Spring 2022

* Claudia Enriquez, Trung-Hieu (Huey) Nguyen, Alex Olyushinets, and Cloe Tom participated in a pilot of the IGNITE CURE. We each sequenced and assembled our own two genomes of Ralstonia isolated from the 1960s. Look out for a Genome Announcement soon!

* Collaborator Mohommed Arif released a preprint on a new multiplex PCR assay that can simultaneously identify whether the strain is in the Ralstonia species complex, which species it is a part of, and whether it is in the highly regulated pandemic clade ("Race 3 Biovar 2"). [Read about it here](https://twitter.com/ariflab_UH/status/1529870253219426306).

* Caitilyn Allen (Tiffany's PhD advisor) visited Davis to present an awesome seminar on the biology of Race 3 Biovar 2 pathogens. We had a lab dinner and Steve Lindow (Tiffany's postdoc advisor) joined. [We did not plan to match our clothes so well](https://twitter.com/CaitilynAllen/status/1532827040981864456)  

## Winter 2022

* Nathalie mentored a dynamic duo (Liz Jiang and Yali Bai) on a bacterial GWAS analysis.

## Fall 2021

We welcomed three new full time researchers to the team:

* Dr. Nathalie Aoun is a new postdoctoral fellow in the lab. Nathalie earned her PhD with Richard Berthomé and Fabrice Roux in Laurent Deslandes's group at LIPME (Toulouse, France). Nathalie is a statistics wizard who honed her experimental design and analysis skills through a highly productive 3 year PhD. Nathalie carried out GWAS screens to identify Arabidopsis resistance mechanisms that functioned at cool and tropical temperatures. Several of her PhD papers are published, and more are on their way. 

* Matt Cope-Arguello is a new PLP graduate student who joins us from California State University-San Marcos. Matt had a diverse array of undergraduate research experiences that involved exploring microbial ecology and engineering: FISH visualization of dental plaque communities, coastal microbial ecology, and more. 

* Jason Avalos joined the Parales lab as a Junior Specialist, but we consider him an honorary member of the Lowe-Power lab. Jason was an undergraduate researcher on the Global Ralstonia diversity project. Now he is working with Dr. Becca Schomer on the molecular biology of Ralstonia chemotaxis. 

We had two scientists move on:

* Jonathan Beutler completed an excellent M.S. thesis, and he moved to University of British Columbia to work in Gurcharn Brar's cereal pathology lab. 

* Dr. Brian Ingel secured a career position at the California Department of Pesticide Regulation as an Environmental Scientist.

## Summer 2021

* We hosted two remote researchers, Darrielle Williams and Darrell Sparks. They joined our lab this summer through the Plant Agricultural Biology Graduate Admissions Pathways Program [(PABGAP)](https://pabgap.ucdavis.edu/program). Darrielle and Darrell both contributed to the Global Ralstonia Diversity project. Darrielle also explored Jonathan's disease progress data by calculating AUDPCs for over 3,000 individual plants and visualizing the distributions. Darrielle's artistic side shone in her color choices for the plots.

This project was featured on the [Open Plant Pathology blog](https://openplantpathology.org/posts/2021-03-24-rsscdb-a-database-for-tracking-the-global-spread-of-ralstonia-solanacearum-sequevars-and-strains/)

3. We gave the [lab protocols a new look](http://lowepowerlab.ucdavis.edu/protocols/)! They are now view-able as a GitHub Jekyll site, which is a printer-friendly format. 

4. Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power gave a seminar at NCSU in March!  It was great to meet new colleagues and catch up with old colleagues!


## Fall 2020

**October 2020**

Dr. Tiffany Lowe-Power was invited to present the labs' research at the University of Georgia's Plant Pathology seminar series and at UC Davis's Microbiology Seminar series. Dr. Lowe-Power presented *"Why do plants wilt? What X-ray computed microtomography can tell us about a model bacterial pathogen”*. This seminar should be broadly accessible to the general public as well as plant pathologists, plant biologists, and microbiologists. 

The alternate title of the talk is "Shooting plants with X-rays *pew pew*". 

A recording from the UC Davis seminar is available on Youtube: https://youtu.be/TpFLAiaZy94

{% include video id="TpFLAiaZy94" provider="youtube" %}

**Beginning of Fall Quarter!**

The Lowe-Power lab welcomes Jason Avalos and Maria Charco Munoz, two new Global Disease Biology undergraduates who will contribute to the [meta-analysis of *Ralstonia* diversity, distribution, and host range](https://github.com/lowepowerlab/Ralstonia_Global_Diversity/blob/master/README.md).  

Last month, the Lowe-Power lab participated in the Plant Pathology Department Retreat. Stratton gave an excellent presentation that covered his and his labmates' projects in the lab. Dr. Lowe-Power opened a department-wide discussion: "What can we do as individuals, a department, and a field to promote diversity, equity, and inclusion?"

Over the Summer, the lab submitted our first manuscript for peer review. The project was led by two excellent junior scientists. Katie Shalvarjian initiated the project as an undergrad, and Stratton G analyzed the TnSeq data and co-wrote the manuscript.
