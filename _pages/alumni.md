**Jason Avalos** <br> 
Fall 2020-Spring 2021 <br>
UC Davis Major: **Global Disease Biology**  <br>
Research Project: Jason was mentored by Tiffany on the Global Ralstonia Diversity meta-analysis. Jason taught himself to use MEGAX and reconstruct phylogenies using Ralstonia gene sequences from NCBI.

**Grace Lankford** <br> 
Winter - Spring 2021 <br>
UC Davis Major: **Global Disease Biology**  <br>
Research Project: Grace was mentored by Tiffany on a meta-analysis of hospital-acquired infections with Ralstonia spp. Grace taught us a lot about how cousins of our wilt pathogens cause infections in humans.

**Elva Xian** <br> 
Fall 2019-Spring 2021
UC Davis Major: **Global Disease Biology**  <br>
Research Project: Elva was mentored by Stratton to develop an assay that will allow us to investigate inter-bacterial competition, cloned several knockout plasmids, and uses BLAST to compare genomic content of Ralstonia genomes.

**Dayna Alyse Denver**<br>
Summer 2020<br>
**A.A. Natural Science** Mt. San Antonio College
Major: **B.Sc. Microbiology** at Cal Poly Pomona

Dayna is a research student from Cal Poly Pomona joining the lab through the National Summer Undergraduate Research Project (NSURP). Dayna was mentored by Stratton to use BLAST to compare genomic content of Ralstonia genomes. 

**For fun:** photography, kayaking, hiking, providing unsolicited science fun facts, getting overly excited about microbes
**What she did after graduating**: Dayna is a M.S. student at CSU San Marcos.

**Kyle Chipman** <br> 
Winter - Spring 2020 <br>
UC Davis Major: **Global Disease Biology** <br> 
Research Project: Kyle was first mentored by Stratton to create knockout plasmids to make mutant bacteria. Then the covid-19 pandemic hit and Kyle and Tiffany devised a remote research project, called the Global Ralstonia Diversity meta-analysis.

**Amanda Eulano** <br> 
Fall 2019 <br>
Dominican College of California: **Public Health** <br>
Solano Community College: A.S.T. **Biology**, A.A. in **General Science**, and A.A. in **Science & Quantitative Reasoning** <br>
UC Davis Major: **Global Disease Biology** <br>
For fun: shopping, hanging out with my dog üê∂, and traveling 

**What she did after leaving the lab**: Amanda interned at Genentech.

**Katie Shalvarjian** <br> 
**Twitter**: [@kshalv](https://twitter.com/kshalv) <br>
**BS Microbial Biology** UC Berkeley<br>
Katie was a Summer Undergraduate Research Fellow working with Dr. Lowe-Power in the Lindow lab at Berkeley to investigate <i>Ralstonia solacearum</i>'s growth requirements in tomato xylem sap. 

For fun: Rock climbing, baking bread, hiking<br>
 
**What she did after graduating**: In Fall 2019, Katie joined Dr. Dipti Nayak's lab at UC Berkeley where she is a research technician unraveling the mysteries of Archaea. In Fall 2020, Katie started her PhD in the Plant and Microbial Biology department at UC Berkeley.
